# EECS 230 project configuration

This directory contains files for configuring this EECS 230 project:

    CMakeLists.txt - common macro definitions

    README.md - this file

    include/ - C++ header files

        eecs230.h - our version of the book’s header

You probably shouldn’t change anything here. Since the course staff
might change it at will, you should be prepared for merge conflicts.
